# STEAM-Guide
For those unfamiliar with the term, STEAM is an acronym for Sciences, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. For the STEAM.INC project, Arts encompasses artistic, cultural and creative practices, including design. Also the Sciences includes, not only the traditional natural sciences, but also more contemporary topics such as social and environmental sciences. Overall, among other benefits, STEAM is increasingly viewed as a means of equipping the workers of the future with an interdisciplinary understanding that embraces a creative approach and innovative skills.
